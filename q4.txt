Gist Overview

Language: C

Purpose: Simple console calculator with four operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division.

Structure: Single file, procedural code, switch statement based on menu choice, input via scanf, output via printf.

Execution: Program runs once per execution — no loops or persistent session.

Observed Flow

Prints menu with 4 choices.

Reads an integer choice (menu).

For choices 1–4: prompts for two floats, performs the chosen arithmetic, prints the result.

For any other input: prints error message.

Terminates immediately after one calculation.

Issues & Risks

No Input Validation: Does not check scanf return values; invalid input can cause undefined behavior.

Division by Zero: No handling when second number is zero.

Hidden/Bidirectional Unicode: File contains potentially dangerous invisible characters (“Trojan Source” risk).

Poor User Experience: No loop to perform multiple calculations, no retry on invalid input, minimal feedback.

Reverse-Engineered Behavior Notes

Control logic is linear; no function decomposition.

Data flow is simple: menu → inputs → computation → output → exit.

No external libraries or dependencies beyond the C standard library.

Recommendations

Input Safety: Replace scanf with fgets + strtod/strtol, validate every user entry.

Error Handling: Add explicit check before division; handle parsing errors gracefully.

Looping Menu: Allow repeated operations until user chooses to quit.

Security Hygiene: Strip or highlight hidden Unicode characters before compilation.

Code Structure: Modularize into functions (e.g., read_double, do_add, etc.) to improve maintainability and testability.
